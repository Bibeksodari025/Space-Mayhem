## Project Overview

Our graphing calculator allows users to input mathematical equations and visualize their graphs in real time. Features include:
- Support for various mathematical functions (trigonometric, exponential, logarithmic, etc.)
- Zooming and panning functionality for exploring graphs
- User-friendly interface to input equations and modify graphing parameters

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this project, you'll need:

- **C++ Compiler** (GCC or MSVC)
- **SDL2** development libraries
- **CMake** (if using CMake for building)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphing-calculator.git
cd graphing-calculator
